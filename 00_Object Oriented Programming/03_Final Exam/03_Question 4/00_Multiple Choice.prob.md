>>Which of the following is the best explanation for overriding a method? <<

( ) Defining a method with the same name but with a different number of parameters as another method. {{Incorrect because it is an example of overloading methods. (This will be discussed later in the course)}}
( ) Defining a method with the same name but with parameters with different data types as another method. {{Incorrect because it is an example of overloading methods. (This will be discussed later in the course)}}
(x) Defining a method with the same name and parameters as an inherited method. {{Correct because you need to create a method with the same name and parameter as an inherited method for it to be an overridden method.}}
( ) Defining a method with the same name but with a different number of parameters as an inherited method. {{Incorrect because it is an example of overloading methods. (This will be discussed later in the course)}}
( ) Defining a method with the same precondition as another method. {{Incorrect because preconditions are simply a tool for communication and don't affect the what the method does at all.}}
