The method `print()` exists in the subclass and superclass with the same signature, and is overridden by the subclass as shown above. The reason why the subclass `OverrideMethodTwo` overrides the method `print()` is because it wants to print the extra `String` "World" on the console. When the statements `OverrideMethodTestOne objectOne = new OverrideMethodTestTwo();` and `objectOne.print()` are called, the program first searches for the `print()` method in the class `OverrideMethodTestTwo` before it looks for the `print()` method in the superclass, which is why the `print()` method in the subclass is used. If the `print()` method was not overridden in the subclass, only "Java" would end up being printed to the console.
