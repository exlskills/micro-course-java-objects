We classify the classes into "superclass" and "subclass". Let's use the "is-a" relational comparison to show the relationship between the super and the sub class like this; for the program above, `EnglishGreeting` is-a `Greeting`.

The subclass is used to construct objects that look like the superclass's objects, but with added features such as extra variables and methods. In order for the subclass to use the public methods and variables, Java reserved word `extends` is used when implementing inheritance code.

By having a superclass with general methods and variables that apply to all the subclasses, you can save a lot of coding time at the individual subclass level.

You can create objects using the syntax `SuperClass objectname = new SubClass();` because the subclass extends from a superclass and "is-a" superclass. Switching the position of the superclass and the subclass here will throw an error.
