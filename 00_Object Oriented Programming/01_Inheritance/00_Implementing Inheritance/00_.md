Object oriented languages like Java have a feature called "inheritance" which allow programmers to define new classes based on an existing class. Instead of starting from nothing, we can build upon a previously existing class, or a "superclass", and add more variables and methods to the superclass. The program below shows a simple implementation of inheritance.
