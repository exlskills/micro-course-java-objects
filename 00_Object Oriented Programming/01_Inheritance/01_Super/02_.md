The word `super` is usually used to call the constructor, but could also be used to call methods. When you start using inheritance in the future, you will most likely be using `super` more for invoking constructors of the superclass. In the code above, `SuperTestTwo` invokes the constructor of its superclass `SuperTestOne` and sets `parameterOne` directly from the superclass. Therefore, when the `print()` method is called in the `SuperTestTwo` class, it prints 10.

Remember that `super();` has to be the first statement in the subclass' constructor. Otherwise, you will get a compile-time error. Also, if you extend a class without a zero-argument constructor, like `SuperTestTwo` above, make sure to use one of the superclass' constructors and have the same parameters. Another data type in the parameter would cause an error. But, if the constructor in the superclass has no arguments(parameters), Java will automatically call one for you in the subclass, so `super();` will not be necessary in that case.
