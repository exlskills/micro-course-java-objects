Java functions with "single inheritance", meaning that a subclass can only inherit from one superclass. The reserved word `extends` can only be used to extend from one class. However, Java has interfaces, a class that allows multiple inheritance. An interface is a set of requirements that a class must implement. An interface is a list of constants and method headers with no method bodies. All methods and constants must be implemented by the class. Let's see how an interface can be used.
