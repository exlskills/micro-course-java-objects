The Java reserved word `implements` is used instead of `extends` for interfaces. You are able to implement multiple interfaces by separating them with a comma. The class that implements an interface inherits the methods and the instance variables of the interface. However, similar to abstract classes, the methods have to be declared inside the class with a proper method body. The variables implemented in the interface do not necessarily have to be used in the class. In addition, methods from the interface must be declared `public`. All variables in an interface are `public`, `static`, and `final` by default.
