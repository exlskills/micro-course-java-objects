All Java objects are polymorphic. "Polymorphism" is the ability of an object to take on different forms. The most common use of polymorphism occurs when the superclass reference is used to refer to a subclass object. We touched on this concept in the chapter on inheritance. Superclasses can be used to create objects such as `Superclass objectName = new SubClass();`. The program below is an example of using both an abstract class and an interface.
