We utilized type casts and the idea of polymorphism by creating the object `polymorphismExample` using `Object` and `PolymorphismExample`. We have to cast the object so that the program knows which methods we are calling. Because the `PolymorphismExample` class is not overriding methods from the `Object` class, casting is required.

For a programmer, it is essential to know about objects and when to use each type of class as we progress to higher level coding, programing, and idea developing. Look back at the topics covered thus far to ensure a strong grasp of all concepts before moving forward. It is imperative to have a strong foundation in order to build tall.
