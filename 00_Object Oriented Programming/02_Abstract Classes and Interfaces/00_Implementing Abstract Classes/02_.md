The class `AbstractClassesExample` inherits the two abstract methods `print()` and `printGreeting()` from the abstract class `AbstractClassTest`. When extending from an abstract class, we first define a method with the same name as an abstract method before overriding them with the proper method in a regular class. If `print()` or `printGreeting()` did not exist in the `AbstractClassesExample` class, it would cause an error. In a rare situation where necessary, an abstract class can also extend and implement another abstract class.
