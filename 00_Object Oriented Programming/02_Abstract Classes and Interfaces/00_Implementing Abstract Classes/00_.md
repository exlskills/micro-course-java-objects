In Java an "abstract" class is a class that cannot be instanced but is a superclass for several other related subclasses. The abstract class contains abstract and non-abstract methods, variables, and even constructors that the subclass inherits. The Java reserved word `abstract` can only be used in an abstract class and will cause an error if used in a regular class. This is how an abstract class can be utilized.
