The default method for objects only checks whether two objects have the same reference. It does not look at the values of the objects inside the reference to see if those are the same. Therefore, it will work exactly the same as the "==" operator. That is why `exampleVariableTwo` returns "true" as the reference of the two variables is the same. Even though `objectEqualityTest` and `objectEqualityTestOne` have the exact same statement with the same parameters, it returns "false" because they are two individual objects.

The way to handle this issue in your own work is to create your own `equals()` method in your class and override the default one. We will learn how to override methods later in the course.
