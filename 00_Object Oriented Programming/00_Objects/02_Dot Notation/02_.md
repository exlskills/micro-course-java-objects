If you recollect from the section on Access Control, only the `public` methods and variables can be accessed through the object. Private methods are not accessible. For classes that are included in Java packages, you can find the documentation online to see what the available public method and variables are. And you can make sure the variables in your classes are either set as `public` or `private` depending on whether or not you want to allow the object to access it and change its data if needed. When you attempt to access a private member of a class, you will throw a runtime error.

Also, when you see Java reserved word `this` like `this.variablename`, it is a reference to a current object whose method or constructor is being invoked. It's usually unnecessary to use this reserved word but make sure you know how it works.
