Do you remember casting `int` and `double` data types? "Type Casts" are similar to casting but for objects. <br>

The syntax for type casts is as follows, `(requiredType)(expression/variable)`. <br>

Something to remember when type casting objects is whether or not the class is a "descendant" of another one class (has a parent class). If so, we can create objects that incorporate two different classes. We will look at the concept of inheritance later in the course. For now, keep in mind that every single class is a "descendant" of a class called `Object` that exists in the package `java.lang` (automatically-imported), so you can create objects like the one below.
