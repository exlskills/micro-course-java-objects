When we call `Object exampleVariableOne = new TypeCastTest()`, `exampleVariableOne` becomes an instance of both `Object` and `TypeCastTest`. Even though this is allowed in Java, you can't actually call a method or access a variable from the `TypeCastTest` class because you have to specify which instance you are referring to when attempting to access any members of a class. The solution is to cast `exampleVariableOne` to a `TypeCastTest` so that the program sees which class you are referring to and accesses the members from the right class.

This is one of the more complex ideas in object-oriented programming, but will be crucial when we dive into inheritance and interface later in the course.
