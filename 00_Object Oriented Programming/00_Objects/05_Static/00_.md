A "static" object is unique; it belongs to the class rather than the instance of the class. In other words, a static variable is only allocated to the memory once: when the class loads. No matter how many instances you create from a class, the static variable is only allocated to the memory once, making your program memory efficient. When a program is running and there's only one instance of something, it is "static". Take a look at the program below for examples of `static` methods and variables, and how we can call them without the use of an object.
