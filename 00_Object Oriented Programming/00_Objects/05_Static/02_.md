We don't need to create a new object to access "static" members of a class. We call the class name and use "dot notation" to specify the member we want to access. Static members are attached to a class rather than an object or an instance of the class.

As a programmer, it is important to note that since there is only one version of the "static" members, when the variable's value is changed, the value of that variable is changed for every object in the class.

Also, keep in mind that the main method of each class is `static` because there are no objects that exist for the class when the JVM calls the main method. Objects are usually created inside the main method, which is why the method itself has to be `static`.
