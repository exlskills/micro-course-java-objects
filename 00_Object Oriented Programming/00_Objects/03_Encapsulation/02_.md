The `EncapsulationTest` class consists of two main members, the `private` variable `exampleVariableOne` and the method `getVariableOne()`. This is a "getter" method, which returns the value of a `private` member of the class. This method ensures `exampleVariableOne` will never be in danger of being changed or manipulated even though it is visible through the getter method. This is one example of how encapsulation works. It's a concept that will help you avoid unwanted errors when writing big programs.
