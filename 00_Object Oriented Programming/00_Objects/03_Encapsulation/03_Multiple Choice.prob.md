>>Which of the following best describe encapsulation? <<

( ) Fields and methods can be directly accessed by any class. {{Incorrect because encapsulation is making data private so that only the original class has direct access.}}
( ) Fields and methods can be hidden inside of an object using the Java reserved word <code>public</code>. {{Incorrect because the Java reserved word <code>private</code> is used when making data private.}}
( ) Fields and methods can be directly accessed by any other class as long as the two classes are related. {{Incorrect because even classes that are related and implement each other cannot access private data of another class.}}
( ) Fields and methods can be hidden inside of an object using the Java reserved word <code>hidden</code>. {{Incorrect because "hidden" is not a Java reserved word.}}
(x)  Fields and methods can be hidden inside an object so that they cannot be directly altered by other classes. {{Correct because it clearly shows how the purpose of encapsulation.}}
