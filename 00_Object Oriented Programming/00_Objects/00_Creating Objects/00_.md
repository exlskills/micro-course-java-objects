We have already worked with objects in previous chapters; they are some of the building blocks in Java. Let's go back to the basics and explore objects from their foundation. There are three properties that each object has. First, each object has a unique "identity" that makes it distinct from any other. Second, each object has a current "state", meaning it currently contains a value that has the ability to change. And third, an object has a "behavior" which enables it to call and run methods. Let's create an object below.
