Objects refer to a particular instance of a class. In Java, this allows us to create particular instances of classes and store them in variables called objects. The syntax for creating most objects is as follows:

`ClassName variableName = new ConstructorName(parameters);`

As you have seen previously, the constructor name is the same as the class name. Objects can have parameters inside the parenthesis, depending on the constructor of the other class.

When you create a new `ArrayList` and use the reserved word `new`, it makes an object from the original `ArrayList` class and stores it inside the name of your `ArrayList`. This is why you can use dot notation (.) and directly call methods and variables that exist in the original `ArrayList` class as they also exist in the instance you created. However, you still need a "main class" containing a functioning main method in order for your program to compile and run. Have you tried creating an object of the class itself in the main method? We will see these later in the course!
